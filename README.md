# Frontend frameworks / libraries comparison 

I'm setting out on a journey to test different front-end frameworkrs / libraries and see how they compare with standard javascript. 

The goal is to implement a simple script that inspect a page where there are input text controls with class "perc_input" and then make sure that the sum of the value of all the controls (inside one div block) is always 100 (Basically i'm implementing a percentage input block). 

To start with i would like to compare: 

* Default Javascript 
* AngularJS
* React 

Let's get started....
